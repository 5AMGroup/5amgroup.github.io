			<h2>Game Plan</h2>
				Game Based Around: Binding of Issac<br>
				Texture Around: JetPack Joyride
				<br>
				<p>
				There are many maps and each map has two doors.
				When you go through a door, you go to a new map.<br>
				The map has 1 unique door which goes to another unexplored map or you can go through the door which you came from.<br><br>
				
				Make a labyrith with the doors, where the player has to go through doors, to find the exit or the end boss.<br>

				<h2> <a>Diary</a></h2>
				This will be a diary of progression of our 2D animation game<br>
				<h3>Session 1 - Start</h3>
				We spent majority of the time working on the webpage instead of focusing on the game. 
				<h3>Session 2 - Coding</h3>
				We finally started working on the code. We created the map on Tiled and displayed it in our game.<br>
