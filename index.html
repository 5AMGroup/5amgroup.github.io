			Hello
		There are many maps and each map has two doors.
		When you go through a door, you go to a new map.
		The map has 1 unique door which goes to another unexplored map or you can go through the door which you came from.
		Make a labyrith with the doors, where the player has to go through doors, to find the exit or the end boss.
		This will be a diary of progression of our 2D animation game
